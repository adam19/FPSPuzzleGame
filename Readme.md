FPS Puzzle Game
===============
This project was part of an interview test where I was challenged to build a game, any game in any engine of my choice within a 24 hour period. 
I came up with the idea for a FPS puzzle game. Right now, the game only contains a single level. I might choose to expand on it later.


Building
========
- Built with Unity 2017.3.0f3
- This was only tested on PC, but you can build it just like any other PC game. Open File -> Build Settings -> Build.


How to Play
===========
Normal WASD keyboard controls with mouse-look. Left-click allows the player to interact with the environment. 
HIGHLY recommended to play with headphones or speakers. I didn't initially have time to add additional prompts for pickups and interactions.
